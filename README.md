# Hubot

This is a version of GitHub's chat bot, [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/). Hubot's pretty cool. We deploy it to EC2 via [Sendak](https://github.com/18F/Sendak).

### Testing Hubot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following.

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output about where your scripts come from and a
prompt.

Then you can interact with hubot by typing `hubot help`.

    Hubot> hubot help
